# Smart Parking System

## Introduction

The Smart Parking System is a web application designed to streamline the process of finding and reserving parking spaces.  This system leverages modern technologies to provide a user-friendly interface and efficient management of parking resources.  The backend utilizes FastAPI for its speed and efficiency, while Docker ensures easy deployment and portability.  The entire system is designed for scalability and deployment on AWS.

## Features

* **Real-time Parking Availability:** View the current availability of parking spaces in real-time on a map interface.
* **Reservation System:** Reserve parking spaces in advance, ensuring a spot is waiting when you arrive.
* **Payment Integration:** Secure online payment processing for reserved parking spaces.  (Future implementation)
* **User Management:**  User accounts with personalized preferences and parking history. (Future implementation)
* **Admin Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for managing parking spaces, reservations, and user accounts. (Future implementation)
* **Intuitive User Interface:**  A clean and easy-to-use web interface for both users and administrators.


## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript (Future implementation of more sophisticated frontend framework)
* **Database:**  (To be specified -  e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)  *Currently not implemented.*
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
* **Programming Languages:** Java (for potential future components), Python


## Getting Started

This project is currently under development.  The following instructions outline the setup for the backend FastAPI application.  Frontend development will be detailed in future updates.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd smart-parking-backend
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **(Optional) Configure Database:** Set up your chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and update the database connection string in the configuration file.  *Database integration is not yet implemented.*

## Usage

Once the backend is running, you can access it via the specified API endpoints.  Detailed API documentation will be provided in a future release.  The frontend will interact with these endpoints to display parking information and handle user interactions.

To run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Docker Deployment (Backend Only)

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t smart-parking-backend .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 smart-parking-backend
   ```
